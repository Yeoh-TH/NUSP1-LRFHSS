# NUSP1-LRFHSS
Successful implementation of LRFHSS communication with Semtech LRFHSS gateway V2. This sketch shows a mock Ground station and mock satellite system, where in the serial monitor of the satellite if a command is sent by the user, the exact message is transmitted and processed in the ground station. All done on a Heltech Cubecell AB-02S module.
